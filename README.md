For MHacks X, we decided to build a project that allows you to order Lyft just with SMS! We built it using Node.js for back-end and utilized the Lyft API and Twilio API. Unfortunately, the project is not fully functional, but we hope to fully implement it someday! It is created by Anna Sedlackova, Vincent Portelli and Michael Smith.
